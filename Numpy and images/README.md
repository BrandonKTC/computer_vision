# Images

- Each single digit image can be represented as an array
 - Then how dark a pixel should be can be represented as a value between 0 and 1.

Color images can be represented as  a combination of red, green and blue, when reading an image and check it shape, it will look something like:
- (1280, 720, 3)
  - 1280 pixel width
  - 720 pixel height
  - 3 color channels

the computer just knows that there are 3 intensity channels, each channel alone is essentially the same as a grayscale image.
