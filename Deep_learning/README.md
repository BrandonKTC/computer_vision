# Machine Learning

- Basics
Machine Learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building, Using algorithms that iteratively learn from data. Machine learning allows computers to find hidden insights without being explicitly programmed where to look.

- Process
  - Data Acquisition
  - Data Cleaning
  - Split into Training Data / Test Data
  - Model Building & Testing
  - Model Deployment

# Deep Learning

- Neuron
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) know as perceptron attempt to mimic biological neurons, it has:
  - Input Layers (Real values from the data)
  - Hidden Layers (Layers in between input and output, >= 3 layers is "deep network")
  - Output Layer (Final estimate of the output)

- Activation function:
  - Sigmoid ( 0 , 1 )
  - tanh ( -1 , 1 )
  - ReLU ( 0 , f(max(x)) )
