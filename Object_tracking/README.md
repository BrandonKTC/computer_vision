### Learn basic object ttracking techniques

- [x] Optical Flow

  - Optical flow is the pattern of apparent motion of image objects between two consecutive frames caused by the movement of object or camera.

- [x] MeanShift and CamShift

  - MeanShift, based on a given target to track, it calculate the color histogram of the target area, and then keep sliding the tracking window to the closest match.
  - Meanshift won't change the window size if the target moves away or towards the camera. CamShift however update the size of the window (it's continuous MeanShift)
